               <p> The school building opened during the 1965–66 school year. Additions to the original structure 
                   were completed in 1973, 1982 and 2005. The school is approved by the New Jersey Department of 
                   Education and is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools.</p>

                Mercer County Community College (MCCC) is a public, community college in Mercer County, New Jersey. 
                More than 7,000 students enroll in one or more credit courses each year.[1][2] </p>

            <p>Established in 1966, MCCC has an open-door admission policy. The 292-acre (1.18 km2) West Windsor Township
                 Campus was opened in 1971 to serve the needs of Mercer County residents. The main buildings on campus 
                 feature brutalist architecture, popular in 1960s college campus construction. The continually expanding 
                 James Kerney Campus, located in the heart of New Jersey's capital city, Trenton, serves as an educational 
                 and cultural hub for urban residents.[3]

        <p>The giant panda  also known as the panda bear (or simply the panda), is a bear[6] native to
             South Central China.[1] It is characterised by its bold black-and-white coat 
             and rotund body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it 
             from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid. Though it belongs to the order 
             Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves making 
             up more than 99% of its diet.[7] Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat 
             other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or 
             carrion. In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, 
             oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.[8][9]</p>

        <p>Rats are various medium-sized, long-tailed rodents. Species of rats are found throughout 
            the order Rodentia, but stereotypical rats are found in the genus Rattus. Other 
            rat genera include Neotoma (pack rats), Bandicota (bandicoot rats) and Dipodomys
             (kangaroo rats).<br><br>
             Rats are typically distinguished from mice by their size. Usually the common name 
               of a large muroid rodent will include the word "rat", while a smaller muroid's 
               name will include "mouse". The common terms rat and mouse are not taxonomically 
               specific. There are 56 known species of rats in the world.[1]</p>

        <p>When I started drawing 14 years ago, it didn't occur to me that I would or 
            could get better. I didn't view learning-to-draw in terms of a learning 
            curve (no pun intended). I didn't start with the intention of building my 
            skills - I started drawing to pass the time when my kids were at swimming 
            lessons and gymnastics classes and dentist appointments. Hand-drawn circles 
            resembling cantaloupes, triangles with wobbly angles, you get the idea.<br> <br>

            And what I learned after years of drawing is that if you draw a 
               lot, you get better. It’s not magic! I like to draw all sorts of 
               things, and I noticed that the variety helped me stay engaged. So 
               definitely keep drawing! It’s easy to lose steam and think you’re 
               not making progress. But it is happening! Keep drawing and you’ll 
               gradually feel more comfortable|confident with your drawing tools 
               and build fine motor skills.</p>
